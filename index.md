# Welcome!

This blog is about all things in a developers life. I cover
12 factor apps, CI/CD best practice, secure software supply
chains, Kubernetes, and anything else in the DevOps realm.

The website is split into levels:-

- [Level 100 Explainers](/level-100): Introductory material for key terms and concepts. Like a detailed glossary for terminology
- [Level 200 Tasks](/level-200): How to do a thing. One level deeper than the usual 'hello world' blog posts you see
- [Level 300 Projects](/level-300): Detailed project based examples. 'Real world' projects, or as near as I can make them, linking level 200 activities together for a defined outcome

This should provide a range of material suitable for all levels.
