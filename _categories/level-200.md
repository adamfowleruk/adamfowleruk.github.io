  Level 200 posts show how to do a useful thing in isolation.
  They're ideal for refreshing your brain or doing something
  for the first time.

  I don't do 'hello world' style posts, so these will
  actually mention real-world issues of using a particular
  approach, and mention best practice rather than just
  'get it working' style instructions.
